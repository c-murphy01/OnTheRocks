## Description

On The Rocks is a cocktail recipe website for EE417. Currently in the very basic stages, it has a simple home page, 
a recipes page which features a small number of recipes, a tips & tricks page, and a contact page.

### Inspiration

Having worked as a bartender for most of my time in university, I looked for a website or app that would 
let me find cocktail recipes easily based on a search by ingredients, and could not find one that offered its 
services free of charge, so I decided to use this assignment to create one that I can use.

## Instructions

To run the website on your local machine:
- Download the ZIP file of the project.
- Extract the files.
- Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.

## Technologies Used

**HTML5**: Used for the basic structure of the website

**CSS**: Used to add styling to the website. Two external CSS files were used. They are:
- **Normalize.css**: A small CSS file found [here](github.com/necolas/normalize.css). This provides consistency across browsers
- **FontAwesome**: This is used to add icons across the website.

**JavaScript**: Used to add interactivity and functionality to the website
