                    <h3>Shaking & Stirring</h3>
                    <p>
                        The hallmark of any great bartender is their ability to master stirring and shaking cocktails 
                        effortlessly with consistent results. While stirring with a cocktail mixing glass does take a 
                        little practice and shaking is just plain fun, you can easily pick up a few techniques in no time.
                    </p>
                    <h5>To Shake or To Stir? That is the Question.</h5>
                    <p>
                        Stirring a recipe is gentler and allows spirits to mix together without chipping the ice and over 
                        diluting the cocktail. Stirring is good for cocktails like Negronis and Manhattans. Shaking a 
                        cocktail will chill the mixture faster than stirring. Shaking is best with cocktails that need 
                        the ice to break apart and mix with a combination of dairy, liqueurs, fruit juices, eggs, or 
                        sour mixes. Shaking is ideal for cocktails like Margaritas or Cosmopolitans. Almost every recipe 
                        should spell out what to do, but do make a note which method of mixing you'll need to use in your 
                        drink recipe beforehand so that you are properly prepared with the tools necessary.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Shaking it Out</h5>  
                    <p>
                        If I say cocktail, what's the first image that pops into your head? That's right, someone using 
                        a shaker. To shake like a pro, find a shaker that you can hold firmly in your hands and can easily 
                        seal and open. Treat the contents inside as one solid mass you're moving back and forth quickly. 
                        Aim for about 10 seconds of vigorous, over the shoulder shaking.
                    </p>    
                    <h5>How to Use a Bar Spoon in Less Than 10 Seconds</h5>    
                    <p>
                        Stirring with a bar spoon does require a little technique. Place the spoon up against the inside 
                        of your mixing glass with the curved surface facing out. Begin stirring slowly, gradually picking 
                        up speed, keeping the spoon up against the inside of the glass at all times (this prevents ice chips 
                        and too much dilution). Within moments you'll be enjoying a professionally finished cocktail.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Garnishes</h3>
                    <p>
                        Before you smell a food, or taste a drink, you devour it with your eyes. That's why garnishes are 
                        a great way to spruce up any cocktail. Sure, they add a little flavor, but their big impact comes 
                        from the visual appeal. With the right technique, making your own garnish is easy and most definitely 
                        Instagram-worthy.
                    </p>   
                    <h5>The wheel and the wedge:</h5>
                    <p>
                        A wedge is 1/8 a lemon, lime or orange. It's essentially just a chunk, cut out and “wedged” on the 
                        side. The wheel, on the other hand, is a perfect circle of a citrus fruit with a slit on one end 
                        that allows you to set it on the drink's rim. To make a wheel, cut off the ends of the fruit and 
                        then cut slices from one end to the other.
                    </p>    
                    <h5>The twist:</h5>        
                    <p>
                        To make a twist, all you need is a sharp knife. Cut both ends off the fruit and separate it from 
                        its skin. Roll the skin up, and cut it, so you're left with a long piece of citrus skin. The twist 
                        not only looks complex, and beautiful, but the oil from the citrus fruit permeates your sense of 
                        smell to enhance the experience.
                    </p>  
                    <h5>The peel:</h5>
                    <p>
                        This effortless garnish is typically placed in drinks like the Old Fashioned. Simply use a knife 
                        to cut an oval shape out of the fruit's skin—but not too deep or you'll get the bitter flavor of 
                        the pith. Before placing this garnish in the drink, rub it around the glass rim to impart some 
                        citrus flavor.
                    </p> 
                    <h5>The skewer:</h5>
                    <p>
                        The skewer is the most versatile garnish of them all. From simple fruit to savory treats, each 
                        drink can look uniquely yours but skewering your favorite fruits and veggies on a stick
                    </p> 
                    <h5>Fresh Herbs:</h5>
                    <p>
                        Herbs can bring freshness, flavor and some color to a cocktail. A popular one is fresh mint. 
                        And here's a tip: when using mint, slap it in your palm right before adding it to a drink to 
                        release its aroma.

                    <h3>How to stir a Cocktail</h3>
                    <p>
                        Stirring seems so simple, but when it comes to cocktails, merely spinning a spoon won't get 
                        you that well mixed drink you crave. There's an art to stirring cocktails and with a little practice, 
                        you'll be an expert.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Shaken or Stirred?</h5>
                    <p>
                        The famous question that leaves many a person puzzled. Shaking is the process of chilling and 
                        diluting a drink with ice by moving it back and forth swiftly in a shaker. The rapid rattling 
                        causes the ice to break down more quickly, thus releasing more water into your drink. This is 
                        great for mixed drinks with juice or dairy, but doesn't work as well when the drink is carbonated.
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        While shaking ingredients is a more thorough method of mixing, shaking clear ingredients 
                        (such as vodka, gin and whiskey) destroys the silky texture and body of the ingredients, leaving 
                        them cloudy, foamy and pretty unappetizing. Stirring, on the other hand, helps maintain the clarity 
                        and flavor of your distilled spirits.
                    </p>        
                    <h5>Create a Stir</h5>
                    <p>
                        Once you've decided to stir things up, make sure you have the proper tools. Start with a bar 
                        spoon — a long spoon with a twisted handle. The length of the spoon ensures you can mix drinks 
                        in even the tallest of glasses, while the twisted handle allows for the spoon to rotate easily 
                        in your hand. This means a more fluid motion, and a better mixed drink.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you have a bar spoon in hand, chill a mixing glass and pour your ingredients in. Insert the bar 
                        spoon, and, with it pinched between your middle and index finger, move it around in a circular motion, 
                        focusing on keeping the back of the spoon against the glass. This method helps cool the drink down, 
                        while still maintaining its clarity.
                    </p>      
                    <p>
                        Remember: Don't just give it one spin around!  Stir for about 30 seconds to ensure all your ingredients 
                        are combined well. For more complicated drinks with a whole lot of ingredients, such as mojitos, you 
                        can use your spoon to lift up fallen ingredients and distribute them throughout the cocktail.
                    </p>

                    <h3>How to use a shaker</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Boston Shaker is perhaps the most famous and flashy of all bartending tools. Consisting of a 
                        simple pint glass and a bar tin, the Boston Shaker is not only great for mixing cocktails, but it's 
                        perfect for adding some panache and showmanship to your bartending. The sound alone of a Boston 
                        Cocktail Shaker being used at a party is more than enough to get guests in the mood and set their 
                        mouths to watering.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Is it difficult to learn how to use a Boston Shaker? Watching a professional might seem intimidating, 
                        but it's very easy to use. Once you get the hang of it, you'll jump at the chance to spend time 
                        showing off behind the bar at your next soirée. Follow these smart suggestions and simple 
                        step-by-step instructions, and you'll be ready to retire your blender and take things into your own 
                        hands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Always remember: build your cocktail by adding ingredients like juices, sweeteners & modifiers into 
                        your mixing glass first, and then adding the spirits. That way, if you make a mistake, you can start 
                        over without wasting your spirits.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Step By Step:</h5>
                    <ul>  
                        <li>Fill the mixing tin, not the glass, halfway with hard, dry ice cubes.</li>
                        <li>Mix the ingredients in the glass, separate from the tin of ice.</li>
                        <li>Let's get ready to shake. Pour the mixture from the glass into the tin.</li>
                        <li>Hold the tin on a hard surface. Place the glass in tin and hit the bottom until they 'lock' 
                            together (one whack with the heel of your hand will do it).</li>
                        <li>Turn it over with the glass half pointed behind you and shake it hard. 7 to 10 seconds is a good 
                            count.</li>
                        <li>To break the seal, hold the shaker with the tin down and hit the tin above where the glass and 
                            tin meet. (Never bang the Boston Cocktail shaker on the edge of the bar).</li>
                        <li>Place a Hawthorne Strainer over the top of the tin, and pour the drink into an appropriate 
                            cocktail glass. Always remember to garnish.</li>
