                            <button class="btn accordion-btn">
                                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-down-long"></i>
                            </button>
                        </div>
                        <div class="tip-content">
                            <p>
                                The hallmark of any great bartender is their ability to master stirring and shaking cocktails 
                                effortlessly with consistent results. While stirring with a cocktail mixing glass does take a 
                                little practice and shaking is just plain fun, you can easily pick up a few techniques in no time.
                            </p>
                            <h5>To Shake or To Stir? That is the Question.</h5>
                            <p>
                                Stirring a recipe is gentler and allows spirits to mix together without chipping the ice and over 
                                diluting the cocktail. Stirring is good for cocktails like Negronis and Manhattans. Shaking a 
                                cocktail will chill the mixture faster than stirring. Shaking is best with cocktails that need 
                                the ice to break apart and mix with a combination of dairy, liqueurs, fruit juices, eggs, or 
                                sour mixes. Shaking is ideal for cocktails like Margaritas or Cosmopolitans. Almost every recipe 
                                should spell out what to do, but do make a note which method of mixing you'll need to use in your 
                                drink recipe beforehand so that you are properly prepared with the tools necessary.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Shaking it Out</h5>  
                            <p>
                                If I say cocktail, what's the first image that pops into your head? That's right, someone using 
                                a shaker. To shake like a pro, find a shaker that you can hold firmly in your hands and can easily 
                                seal and open. Treat the contents inside as one solid mass you're moving back and forth quickly. 
                                Aim for about 10 seconds of vigorous, over the shoulder shaking.
                            </p>    
                            <h5>How to Use a Bar Spoon in Less Than 10 Seconds</h5>    
                            <p>
                                Stirring with a bar spoon does require a little technique. Place the spoon up against the inside 
                                of your mixing glass with the curved surface facing out. Begin stirring slowly, gradually picking 
                                up speed, keeping the spoon up against the inside of the glass at all times (this prevents ice chips 
                                and too much dilution). Within moments you'll be enjoying a professionally finished cocktail.

                            <h3>Garnishes</h3>
                            <button class="btn accordion-btn">
                                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-down-long"></i>
                            </button>

                        <div class="tip-content">
                            <p>
                                Before you smell a food, or taste a drink, you devour it with your eyes. That's why garnishes are 
                                a great way to spruce up any cocktail. Sure, they add a little flavor, but their big impact comes 
                                from the visual appeal. With the right technique, making your own garnish is easy and most definitely 
                                Instagram-worthy.
                            </p>   
                            <h5>The wheel and the wedge:</h5>
                            <p>
                                A wedge is 1/8 a lemon, lime or orange. It's essentially just a chunk, cut out and “wedged” on the 
                                side. The wheel, on the other hand, is a perfect circle of a citrus fruit with a slit on one end 
                                that allows you to set it on the drink's rim. To make a wheel, cut off the ends of the fruit and 
                                then cut slices from one end to the other.
                            </p>    
                            <h5>The twist:</h5>        
                            <p>
                                To make a twist, all you need is a sharp knife. Cut both ends off the fruit and separate it from 
                                its skin. Roll the skin up, and cut it, so you're left with a long piece of citrus skin. The twist 
                                not only looks complex, and beautiful, but the oil from the citrus fruit permeates your sense of 
                                smell to enhance the experience.
                            </p>  
                            <h5>The peel:</h5>
                            <p>
                                This effortless garnish is typically placed in drinks like the Old Fashioned. Simply use a knife 
                                to cut an oval shape out of the fruit's skin—but not too deep or you'll get the bitter flavor of 
                                the pith. Before placing this garnish in the drink, rub it around the glass rim to impart some 
                                citrus flavor.
                            </p> 
                            <h5>The skewer:</h5>
                            <p>
                                The skewer is the most versatile garnish of them all. From simple fruit to savory treats, each 
                                drink can look uniquely yours but skewering your favorite fruits and veggies on a stick
                            </p> 
                            <h5>Fresh Herbs:</h5>
                            <p>
                                Herbs can bring freshness, flavor and some color to a cocktail. A popular one is fresh mint. 
                                And here's a tip: when using mint, slap it in your palm right before adding it to a drink to 
                                release its aroma.

                            <p>
                                This classic is named after the simple to make and easy to enjoy Highball—comprised 
                                of a base spirit and a large portion of a non-alcoholic mixer (often a carbonated beverage 
                                like soda). The tall, thin form typically holds between 8 and 12 ounces. With plenty of space 
                                for ice, it will keep drinks nice and cold while preserving that invigorating carbonation.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Old Fashioned Glass</h5>
                            <p>
                                Another glass named after a famous cocktail, though it sometimes goes by the name 'lowball' 
                                or 'rocks' glass. Coming in around 6 to 10 ounces with a low profile, it's perfect for 
                                serving spirits on the rocks or stirred cocktails strained over ice such as a Negroni or 
                                Old Fashioned (bet you didn't see that one coming). 
                            </p>
                            <h5>Martini Glass</h5>
                            <p>
                                Perhaps one of the most iconic cocktail glasses out there, these are perfect for martinis of 
                                any sort (Appletini anyone?), along with any classic drink you may serve 'up' (chilled without 
                                ice). Holding the cocktail by the long stem means the heat from your hands won't warm the liquid, 
                                keeping your cocktail as cool as it looks.   
                            </p>
                            <h5>Coupe Glass</h5>
                            <p>
                                Originally created for Champagne, the coupe has found renewed life in modern cocktail bars serving 
                                drinks sans ice, also known as 'up' (remember the martini glass?). This shallow, broad-bowled glass 
                                typically holds between 4.5 to 9 ounces and makes for a classy-looking cocktail every time.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Flute</h5>
                            <p>
                                If you've ever been out to brunch you're bound to be familiar. They're fun, fancy and perfect for 
                                champagne cocktails like mimosas, bellinis and the ever-opulent French 75.

                            <button class="btn accordion-btn">
                                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-down-long"></i>

                                Stirring seems so simple, but when it comes to cocktails, merely spinning a spoon won't get 
                                you that well mixed drink you crave. There's an art to stirring cocktails and with a little practice, 
                                you'll be an expert.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Shaken or Stirred?</h5>
                            <p>
                                The famous question that leaves many a person puzzled. Shaking is the process of chilling and 
                                diluting a drink with ice by moving it back and forth swiftly in a shaker. The rapid rattling 
                                causes the ice to break down more quickly, thus releasing more water into your drink. This is 
                                great for mixed drinks with juice or dairy, but doesn't work as well when the drink is carbonated.
                            </p>    
                            <p>
                                While shaking ingredients is a more thorough method of mixing, shaking clear ingredients 
                                (such as vodka, gin and whiskey) destroys the silky texture and body of the ingredients, leaving 
                                them cloudy, foamy and pretty unappetizing. Stirring, on the other hand, helps maintain the clarity 
                                and flavor of your distilled spirits.
                            </p>        
                            <h5>Create a Stir</h5>
                            <p>
                                Once you've decided to stir things up, make sure you have the proper tools. Start with a bar 
                                spoon — a long spoon with a twisted handle. The length of the spoon ensures you can mix drinks 
                                in even the tallest of glasses, while the twisted handle allows for the spoon to rotate easily 
                                in your hand. This means a more fluid motion, and a better mixed drink.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once you have a bar spoon in hand, chill a mixing glass and pour your ingredients in. Insert the bar 
                                spoon, and, with it pinched between your middle and index finger, move it around in a circular motion, 
                                focusing on keeping the back of the spoon against the glass. This method helps cool the drink down, 
                                while still maintaining its clarity.
                            </p>      
                            <p>
                                Remember: Don't just give it one spin around!  Stir for about 30 seconds to ensure all your ingredients 
                                are combined well. For more complicated drinks with a whole lot of ingredients, such as mojitos, you 
                                can use your spoon to lift up fallen ingredients and distribute them throughout the cocktail.

                                The Boston Shaker is perhaps the most famous and flashy of all bartending tools. Consisting of a 
                                simple pint glass and a bar tin, the Boston Shaker is not only great for mixing cocktails, but it's 
                                perfect for adding some panache and showmanship to your bartending. The sound alone of a Boston 
                                Cocktail Shaker being used at a party is more than enough to get guests in the mood and set their 
                                mouths to watering.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Is it difficult to learn how to use a Boston Shaker? Watching a professional might seem intimidating, 
                                but it's very easy to use. Once you get the hang of it, you'll jump at the chance to spend time 
                                showing off behind the bar at your next soirée. Follow these smart suggestions and simple 
                                step-by-step instructions, and you'll be ready to retire your blender and take things into your own 
                                hands.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Always remember: build your cocktail by adding ingredients like juices, sweeteners & modifiers into 
                                your mixing glass first, and then adding the spirits. That way, if you make a mistake, you can start 
                                over without wasting your spirits.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Step By Step:</h5>
                            <ol>  
                                <li>Fill the mixing tin, not the glass, halfway with hard, dry ice cubes.</li>
                                <li>Mix the ingredients in the glass, separate from the tin of ice.</li>
                                <li>Let's get ready to shake. Pour the mixture from the glass into the tin.</li>
                                <li>Hold the tin on a hard surface. Place the glass in tin and hit the bottom until they 'lock' 
                                    together (one whack with the heel of your hand will do it).</li>
                                <li>Turn it over with the glass half pointed behind you and shake it hard. 7 to 10 seconds is a good 
                                    count.</li>
                                <li>To break the seal, hold the shaker with the tin down and hit the tin above where the glass and 
                                    tin meet. (Never bang the Boston Cocktail shaker on the edge of the bar).</li>
                                <li>Place a Hawthorne Strainer over the top of the tin, and pour the drink into an appropriate 
                                    cocktail glass. Always remember to garnish.</li>

                            <h3>Flavour Profiles</h3>
                            <button class="btn accordion-btn">
                                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-down-long"></i>
                            </button>
                        </div>
                        <div class="tip-content">
                            <p>
                                When it comes down to it, building a great cocktail profile is just like cooking. The goal is to get 
                                a range of flavors working together in harmony to create something interesting and unique 
                                flavored cocktails. We use words like depth and complexity a lot when speaking about well-made 
                                recipes because they are never just one note. They have layers of flavors brought together in different 
                                ratios to strike that ever-desired balance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We like to breakout flavors—in cooking and cocktails— into five categories: sweet, sour, bitter, spicy 
                                and salty.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Together, these differing cocktail profiles work to enhance one another or balance each other out. If 
                                you want more of a particular flavor category, you can enhance it with a complementary one. Conversely, 
                                if one flavor becomes overpowering, you can add a contradictory one to even the scales a bit.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Sweet</h5>
                            <p>
                                Adding a bit of sweet can help counteract sour, bitter and spice.
                                Bring the sweet with: liqueurs, sugar, syrups, honey, molasses, jams, or flavored sodas.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Example:
                                In a whiskey sour, the sourness from the lemon juice is balanced the sweetness of the simple syrup.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Sour</h5>
                            <p>
                                Adding sour enhances saltiness and balances out spicy and sweet flavors.
                                Add some sour with: Citrus juice (lemon, lime, orange, grapefruit, etc.), vinegar, cider, tomato 
                                juice, pickled vegetables.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Example:
                                In the Bee's Knees cocktail, the rich and sweet honey syrup is perfectly complemented by the tart 
                                and vibrant lemon juice.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Bitter</h5>
                            <p>
                                Adding a touch of bitter balances sweet and salty.
                                For a bit more bitter add: coffee, cocoa (not the sweetened kind), grapefruit , hops or, 
                                of course, bitters.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Example:
                                One of the oldest tricks in the book, the sugar (typically in the form of simple syrup these 
                                days) in an old fashioned plays perfectly with the complex flavors of the aromatic bitters.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Spicy</h5>
                            <p>
                                For those who like spice, it's a flavor that plays very nicely with sour or sweet.
                                Spice it up with: hot sauces, wasabi, horseradish, fresh ginger, jalapeños, habaneros, chili 
                                peppers (great for garnishing too!).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Examples:
                                Spice can often be seen used as a bonus flavor added at the front of the sour-based cocktails 
                                we know and love. Spicy margarita. Spicy paloma. You know the drill. It's also a no-brainer 
                                addition to a bloody mary.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Salty</h5>
                            <p>
                                Salty flavors added to cocktails enhance sweetness and counterbalance bitterness.
                                Feeling salty? Add: kosher or sea salt, saline solution, olive brine, soy, tomato juice or 
                                anchovy paste.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Example:
                                Salt rims on favorites like margaritas and palomas are a simple and fun place to start, a 
                                pinch of salt in Paloma (versus just a rim with it) will bring out more grapefruit notes. 
                                Dirty Martinis are also a crowd-pleaser as the olive juice adds the perfect salty component.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Mix It Up</h5>
                            <p>
                                Hopefully these cocktail flavor profiles have given you a better understanding of the recipes 
                                you know and love, showing just why the flavors work so well together. They're a great tool 
                                if you want to start experimenting on your own, as well. The next great cocktail is out there 
                                just waiting to be crafted.
